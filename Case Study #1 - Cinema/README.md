## Questions and Solutions


### 1. What is the booking rate for each film?



### 2. Show films that never had any bookings

```sql
SELECT name
FROM film
LEFT JOIN screening ON film.id=screening.film_id
WHERE screening.id is NULL;
```

**Steps:**
- Use **LEFT JOIN** to return all records from the `film` table, and matching records from the `screening` table where `film.id = screening.film_id`.
If a film doesn't have a corresponding screening, the `screening` columns will be NULL.
- Use **WHERE** to filter the results to only include films that do not have any screenings. In other words, it shows films that have never been scheduled for a screening.

- Film 'New' doesn't have any bookings.

### 3. Top 3 weekdays based on total bookings
### 4. Which film was screened in the most number of unique rooms?
### 5. Which customers booked more than one seat in one booking?

```sql
SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name, booking.id, COUNT(*)
FROM reserved_seat
JOIN booking ON reserved_seat.booking_id = booking.id
JOIN customer ON booking.customer_id = customer.id
GROUP BY booking.id, customer.first_name, customer.last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Steps:**

- Use **SELECT** to retrieve the `customerâ€™s name`, the `booking ID`, and the number of seats reserved in that booking by `COUNT(*)` to count how many seat records are linked to the booking (i.e. how many seats were reserved).
- Use **JOIN** to connect each seat reservation to its related booking record and link the booking to the customer who made it.
- Use **GROUP BY** to group results by each individual booking and customer. This ensures the count of seats is calculated per booking per customer.
- Use **HAVING COUNT(*) > 1** to filter only those groups (bookings) where more than one seat was reserved. So it only shows customers who booked multiple seats in a single booking.
