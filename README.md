# 🧠 SQL Challenge Portfolio

Welcome to my **SQL Challenge Portfolio**, where I solve real-world inspired case studies using structured query language (SQL). This repository demonstrates my ability to extract insights, identify trends, and solve complex problems using SQL queries across diverse domains — from cinema bookings and hospital operations to narrative-based mystery cases.
