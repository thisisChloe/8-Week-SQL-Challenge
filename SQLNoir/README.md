# SQLNoir: Solve Mysteries in the Shadows of the Database

_“In the world of data, every row tells a story. Some rows lie.”_

SQLNoir is more than just a clever name — it’s a genre of learning that blends narrative intrigue with technical challenge. Each case presents just enough of a storyline to draw you in, but never enough to give the answer away. You have to think like a detective — in SQL.

_“Why did this record disappear at 3:42 PM?”_  
_“What do the login logs and employee shifts not want me to see?”_  
_“Who left before the system crashed?”_  

## 🎯 Why I Loved It

I completed both the Beginner and Intermediate cases and found myself genuinely immersed. These weren’t just SQL exercises — they were investigations. Each challenge forced me to:

- Follow clues across multiple tables
- Use precise JOINs and WHERE clauses to uncover truths
- Re-frame problems when my first (or second) attempt led to misleading answers

There were moments I genuinely grinned when a complex JOIN exposed the missing link, or when a layered condition in a subquery revealed a hidden pattern.

## 💡 What Makes SQLNoir Different

- Narrative + Logic: Every puzzle is driven by a plot. You’re not just solving queries — you’re solving stories.
- Failure Leads to Insight: Wrong queries don’t fail silently — they mislead. Which forces deeper debugging and better logic.
- Real Practice: You write real SQL against structured, scenario-based datasets with instant feedback.
  
## 📌 Final Thoughts

Some games teach. Some games entertain. SQLNoir does both.

_Every database hides a secret._  
_Every row has a witness._  
_Every JOIN reveals a truth._
